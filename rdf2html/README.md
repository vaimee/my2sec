HTML files are automatically rendered from RDF sources. To render them:

1. ``install Node.js`` (if necessary)
2. ``npm i`` (to do once to install dependencies)
3. ``node render.js``

Rendering is performed according to ``template.rq``. Please refer [here](https://ns.inria.fr/sparql-template/) for a complete documentation.
