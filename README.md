# My2Sec - The Ultimate PM & HR Suite By Smart Workers for Smart Workers

![Architecture](img/architecture.png?raw=true)

The objective is to create an open source and GDPR compliant suite to support remote working. My2Sec helps smart workers to keep track of the time spent on different activities, by enabling at the same time the production of a trusted and verified profile of the workers' transferable soft and hard skills. My2Sec integrates several open source solutions like [ActivityWatch](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch) for tracking the time spent on different tasks, [OpenProject](https://github.com/opf/openproject) for project management and [SuperSet](https://github.com/apache/superset) as BI tools for KPI assessment. Events generated by ActivityWatch are stored on the local device of the worker who will always have full control on her data. Events that a worker agrees to share are aggregated by AI tools (e.g., [DROOLS](https://www.drools.org)) to provide two indicators: the time spent by workers on different tasks and the transferable skills profile. The skills profile is eventually stored in a [SOLID pod](https://solidproject.org) but can be also available to HR managers through a trustful and semantic DApp built on top of the [ONTOCHAIN ecosystem](https://ontochain.ngi.eu).
