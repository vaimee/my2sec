# ActivityTypeAI

## Future Step:
- Show to the user only the events that don't appear in the knowledge;
- Add the validation phase;
- Store the events in the CSV with only the useful columns (i.e. without duration, event type, etc);
- Apply Sliding Window on 15 days, by default (i.e. remove the events seen above 15 days before from ```knowledge.py```).
